# ABF-converter
Conversion of ABF files to make them compatible with the mini analysis program

## Description
This python script convertes ABF files (Axonâ„¢ Binary File Format) with any ABF file version supported by pyABF into
the compatible version for Mini Analysis Program (ABF Version 1).

## Usage

2. Install all Prerequisites
   - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 3.6+)

5. Place all ABF files you wish to make compatible with the Mini Analysis Program into the folder _input_.
